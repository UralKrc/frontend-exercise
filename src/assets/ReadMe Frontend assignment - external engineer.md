Multi-Select Filter
Overview
In this task, you are required to create a web application that implements a multi-select
filter. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to structure a web app, handle technical
challenges, and showcase your skills in modern frontend development. We would like
you to create the assignment using Typescript and React.
Task Breakdown:
1. Clone the repository and set up the web application.
2. Implement a multi-select filter that allows users to search, filter, and select
multiple items.
The selected items should:
• Be displayed on top of the list, separated from the search results.
• Persist across page reloads (Bonus feature).
• Use best practices in frontend development, following modern
JavaScript/TypeScript, preferably GraphQL otherwise HTTP/REST, Tailwind and
UI/UX standards.
Provided Assets:
• JSON data file: Contains 470 items for the multi-select filter.
• UI design for multi-select: A visual reference for how the filter should look.
• Search Icon: An SVG icon for the search feature.
Functional Requirements:
Display the Multi-Select Filter:
• Fetch the JSON data via preferably GraphQL, otherwise HTTP (e.g., using Fetch
API or Axios).
• Render the data items dynamically in a dropdown or list.
Search and Filter Functionality:
• Implement a search bar that filters the displayed data in real-time as the user
types.
• The filter should be case-insensitive.
Multi-Selection Functionality:
• Allow users to select multiple items from the list.
• The selected items should be highlighted and displayed at the top of the list,
separate from the filtered results.
Persistence of Selected Items (Bonus):
• Store the selected items locally using localStorage or sessionStorage.
• The selected items should persist after a page reload.
Primary Criteria:
• Clean and Structured Code: HTML, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS).
Should be modular, maintainable, and adhere to modern best practices.
• Frontend Architecture: Use a component-based architecture (preferably
React).
• Preferably GraphQL, otherwise HTTP/REST: Interact with the provided JSON
file using HTTP.
• Testing: Utilise Storybook for writing tests. Use Vitest or Jest.
Secondary Criteria (Bonus):
• CSS Preprocessing: Bonus if you use a preprocessor.
• Responsive Design: Ensure the multi-select filter works well on both desktop
and mobile devices.
• State Management: For frameworks like preferably React. Use appropriate
state management (e.g., Context API, Redux).
• Build Setup: Set up a modern build pipeline with tools like Vite, Webpack.
Additional Considerations:
• Code Quality: We are looking for well-structured, readable, and maintainable
code. Use meaningful variable names, break down the app into reusable
components, and avoid duplicated logic.
• Version Control: Use Git for version control. Ensure that you provide a
meaningful commit history.
Submission:
Once you've completed the assignment, push your code to a public GitHub repository.
Include a README in the repository that explains:
• The architecture and any important design decisions.
• How to run the app (e.g., installation instructions, build commands).
• Any challenges you faced and how you solved them.
Evaluation Criteria:
• Code Structure: Clean, modular, and well-organized code that follows best
practices.
• Frontend Knowledge: Use of modern JavaScript (ES6+), HTTP/REST, and
familiarity with common web development tools.
• We would like you to create the assignment using Typescript and React.
• UI/UX: A user-friendly and functional multi-select component that is easy to
interact with.
• Performance: Optimized code with minimal reflows and repaints.
• Creativity & Problem-Solving: Demonstrating your ability to come up with
efficient solutions to handle the filtering and multi-select requirements.
• Bonus Features: Bonus points for features like localStorage persistence,
responsive design, and advanced CSS techniques.
Takeaways:
• We’re interested in how you approach solving the problem and your ability to
handle technical challenges.
• It’s okay if you don’t finish the entire project—what matters is how you structure
your code and how well you communicate your design decisions.
• Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your solution!
